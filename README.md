# C# 7 and .NET Core: Modern Cross-Platform Development - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [C# 7 and .NET Core: Modern Cross-Platform Development - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/c-7-and-net-core-modern-cross-platform-development-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787129559), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
If you want to build powerful cross-platform applications with C# 7 and .NET Core, then this book is for you. By the end of the book, you'll be armed with all the knowledge you need to build modern, cross-platform applications using C# and .NET Core.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
// storing items at index positions
names[0] = "Kate";
names[1] = "Jack";
names[2] = "Rebecca";
names[3] = "Tom";
```

My recommendation for the operating system and development tool combinations is as
follows:
* Windows 10 for Visual Studio 2017
* macOS for Visual Studio for Mac
* macOS for Visual Studio Code
The best version of Windows to use is Microsoft Windows 10 because you will need this
version to create Universal Windows Platform apps in Chapter 13, Building Universal
Windows Platform Apps Using XAML. Earlier versions of Windows, such as 7 or 8.1 will work
for all other chapters.
